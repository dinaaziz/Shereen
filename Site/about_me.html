<h2><strong>Personal Statements</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong><em><u>Teaching: </u></em></strong></h3>

<br />

<p>The opportunities to teach and work with students and to develop new educational materials and techniques<br />

  are my primary reasons for seeking an academic career. My academic background, teaching experience, and 

  career as a clinical pathologist and professor make me well-prepared to teach clinical laboratory science 

as well as more advanced courses on special techniques as flow cytometry, molecular biology and chromatography.</p>

<p>I believe that the emphasis should be on collaboration, planning and design, and critical review. Complex scientific and medical projects are rarely the work of an individual; students must learn to organize and work as teams as early as possible. Similarly, planning and design are essential elements of any large project, but are difficult skills to master.</p>

<p>My personal style of teaching is based on the following principles; <strong><em>Engage the students, establish fair and clear grading policies, set clear and realistic goals , identify and fix misconceptions early, let the students make mistakes and always respect the students. </em></strong></p>

<br />

<h3><strong><em><u>Research:</u></em></strong> </h3>

<br />


<p>Laboratory medicine have been playing an increasingly important role in medicine. My research interests have revolved around the validity of new biomarkers in diagnosis of different diseases using the advanced techniques of molecular biology, chromatography and mass spectrometry.<br />

I am never tired searching for new marker, new techniques or methodology and I believed that as much you are working as much you will be awarded.</p>
